President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order to begin dismantling the US Department of Education, seeking to fulfill decades of conservative ambition to get rid of the agency, but raising new questions for the country’s millions of public schools, student-loan holders and parents.

No president in modern history has tried to close down a Cabinet-level agency. Shutting down the department wholesale would require an act of Congress, which created the agency in 1979. Trump officials acknowledge they don’t have the necessary votes to dissolve the department that way; instead, the order Trump signed Thursday instructed Education Secretary Linda McMahon to take “all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education and return education authority to the states.”

Speaking in the East Room, surrounded by school children in uniforms sitting at classroom desks, Trump said, “We’re going to shut it down, and shut it down as quickly as possible.”

How precisely the components of the Education Department would be dismantled wasn’t precisely clear.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said ahead of Thursday’s signing that the order would move to “greatly minimize the agency,” but that certain “critical functions” like student loans and administering grants for at-risk students would remain under the agency’s umbrella.

Trump, in his remarks, said those functions would be preserved but “redistributed to various other agencies and departments that will take very good care of them.”

The discrepancy could foretell McMahon’s challenge as she works to carry out Trump’s order. While she has fully endorsed the mission of closing the department, she is also required by law to carry out some of its congressionally mandated functions, like administering loans and providing grants for schools in high-poverty areas.

In his remarks, Trump repeatedly cited the imperative of returning control of education to states as his rationale for shuttering the agency, along with what he said were poor test scores compared with high investment-per-student. He said under a new system – without the Education Department – schools could compete with countries in Europe and China, which he said were outcompeting the US.

“I really believe that they’ll be as good as any of them,” he said. “And then you’ll have some laggards and we’ll work with them. And we can all tell you who the laggards will be right now.”

Making what he called a “personal statement,” Trump praised teachers as “among the most important people in this country,” extending an olive branch even to those represented by labor unions who have decried Trump’s executive order.

“I don’t care if they’re in the union or not in the union. That doesn’t matter. But we’re going to take care of our teachers,” he said.

Since taking office, Trump typically signs his executive orders several-at-a-time from the Oval Office, with the actual documents often overshadowed by Trump’s remarks on other topics.

Thursday’s major event in the East Room for the education directive underscored its significance for Trump and fellow conservatives, who have long attempted to shutter the agency and move more control over public schools to individual states.

The initiative has gained momentum in recent years, driven by anger over certain policies and local schools’ curriculums combined with discontent over school closures during the coronavirus pandemic. A parents’ rights movement pushed back on measures in schools meant to address LGBT rights and promote diversity, equality and inclusion.

Almost all public school funding in the United States is provided by states and localities, with those governments exercising control over curriculums. The Education Department is responsible for administering federal funding for students with disabilities, who fall under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, along with Title I funding for low-income schools and federal student loan payments like Pell Grants.

“When it comes to student loans and Pell Grants, those will still be run out of the Department of Education, but we don’t need to be spending more than $3 trillion over the course of a few decades on a department that’s clearly failing in its initial intention to educate our students,” Leavitt told reporters earlier Thursday.

“Any critical functions of the department such as that will remain, but again, we’re greatly reducing the scale and the size of this department,” she added.

Trump has argued publicly for moving some of the agency’s responsibilities to other departments within the federal government. For example, he has previously said oversight of the student loan program could fall under the Small Business Administration, which oversees separate business loans.
